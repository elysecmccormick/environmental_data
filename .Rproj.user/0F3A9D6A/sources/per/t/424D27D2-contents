**Q1 (2 pts.): Qualitatively describe the relationship between body mass and length.Does the relationship seem linear, curved, nonexistent?**

The relationship between body mass and body length seems mostly linear, but left-skewed with an array of outliers. 

**Q2 (2 pts.): Qualitatively describe the shapes of the histograms. Do the data appear normally-distributed? Explain why or why not.Explain why we care (or not) whether the data are normally distributed.**

Body mass seems relatively normally distributed around 40 g, but the middle of the curve is much higher than the rest of the dataset, indicating it's not a perfectly normal distribution. 

Body length is not normally distributed, with what is almost a peak at 100 cm, and very little spread, indicating leptokurtosis. This also indicates it is not a normal distribution. 

Normally distributed data means that we can run parametric tests on the data. Additionally, normal distributions are 

**Q3 (2 pts.): Using both the histograms and normality tests, do you think the (unconditioned) body masses and body length are normally-distributed?Make sure you contrast your visual assessment of normality to the results of the numerical normality tests.**

Between both the histograms and the Shapiro-Wilk tests, I don't think these data are normally distributed. As described in question 2, neither histogram is perfectly normally distributed. Similarly, the p values of the Shapiro-Wilk tests showed p < 0.05 (body mass: p = 4.33e-05, body length: p = 2.2e-16), indicating that the data are not normally distributed. 

**Q4 (2 pts.): Examine the three conditional boxplots.Describe any graphical evidence you see for body mass differences based on species and/or sex.**

When looking by species, the conditional boxplot shows that D. dorsalis has a slightly higher mass. When looking at the conditional boxplot for sex, the boxplots show no difference. When looking at the conditional boxplot for both sex and species, it indicates that in both species, females seem to have a higher weight than male. 

**Q5 (2 pts.): What do you conclude about residual normality based on the numerical and graphical diagnostics?**

The data appear to be non-normal from both the histograms and the Shapiro-Wilk tests. However, the graphical diagnostics would lead me to believe the data are slightly more normal than the Shapiro Tests indicate. The Shapiro-Wilk tests have extremely low p values, while some of the histograms have mild to extreme kurtosis. The first set of residuals is completely leptokurtotic, while the distribution improves with every subsequent model.  

**Q6 (1 pt.): Are violations of the normality assumption equally severe for all the models?**

Graphically no, but the p values from the Shapiro-Wilk tests indicate that all 5 models are very non-normal, with p values well below p = 0.0001. 

**Q7 (2 pts.): What is the magnitude of the mass/length relationship?**

The magnitude of the mass/length relationship is the mean estimate, which in model 1 is 0.8755. 

**Q8 (2 pts.): What is the expected body length of an animal that weighs 100g?**

The expected body length is 76.12 cm. 

**Q9 (2 pts.): What is the expected body length of an animal that weighs 0g?**

The expected body length is 0 cm. 

**Q10 (1 pt.): What is the base level for sex?**

Body mass

**Q11 (1 pt.): What is the base level for binomial?**

Body Mass

**Q12 (1 pt.): Which sex is heavier? How do you know?**

Females are heavier, based on the conditional boxplots. Based on the available output, without post-hoc tests I can't determine this another way.

**Q13 (1 pt.): Which species is heavier? How do you know?**

Delomys dorsalis is heavier, based on the conditional boxplots. From the available output, without post-hoc tests I can't determine this another way. 

**Q14 (1 pt.): Are sex and species significant predictors for body mass?**

Yes, sex and species are significant predictors for body mass.

**Q15 (1 pt.): Is there a significant interaction?**

No, there is not a significant factorial interaction between them, but there is an additive effect between species and sex. 

**Q16 (2 pts.): Examine the p-values for the main effects (sex and species) in all four of the ANOVA tables. Does the significance level of either main effect change very much among the different models?**

No, the significance level stays extremely similar throughout the models. 

**Q17 (1 pt.): Which two models have the lowest AIC?**

Models fit1 and fit4 have the lowest AIC scores.

**Q18 (4 pts.): Which of the two models with lowest AIC scores would you select? Explain your decision based on model fit and the complexity/understanding tradeoff.**

I would choose fit4 as the best model choice. Though it had the second to lowest AIC score (fit1 was lower), fit4 incorporates more complexity while still showing what the best model fit is. This allows us to see interactions between both species and sex within these mice, while fit1 only can analyze body length and body mass. This complexity gives better insight into the biology of the interaction, making fit4 a good model to select. This is a good use of the trade off, as the other three models had varying levels of complexity but higher AIC scores, indicating the fit was not ideal for other models.
